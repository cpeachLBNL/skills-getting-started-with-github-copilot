# GitHub Copilot Agent Mode

## What is Agent Mode?

**Agent Mode** is an enhanced version of GitHub Copilot that goes beyond simple code suggestions. It provides Copilot with a feedback loop, automatically analyzing and improving its own work.

## Key Features

### Automatic Feedback Loop
Agent mode enhances Copilot by automatically providing it feedback - the same types of feedback you would typically provide after reviewing Copilot's suggested edits. This creates a self-improving cycle where Copilot can:

- Inspect its own results for issues, bugs, and inconsistencies
- Review code quality and logic
- Check terminal output and error messages
- Automatically revise its work when problems are detected

### Enhanced Capabilities
- **Multi-step tasks**: Can handle complex, multi-step operations that require coordination between multiple files
- **Error detection**: Automatically identifies and fixes compatibility issues between frontend and backend changes
- **Contextual awareness**: Better understanding of how changes in one part of the codebase affect other parts

## Agent Mode vs. Edit Mode

| Feature | Edit Mode | Agent Mode |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Feedback | Manual review required | Automatic self-review |
| Complexity | Simple, single-step tasks | Complex, multi-step tasks |
| Error handling | May produce incompatible changes | Reviews and fixes its own work |
| Coordination | Changes may not work together | Ensures all changes are compatible |

## When to Use Agent Mode

Agent Mode is particularly useful for:

- **Complex refactoring** that involves multiple files
- **Feature additions** that require both frontend and backend changes
- **Bug fixes** that may have dependencies across the codebase
- **Open-ended requests** where the solution requires multiple coordinated steps

## How to Enable Agent Mode

1. Open the Copilot chat panel in your IDE
2. Use the dropdown menu to switch from "Edit" to "Agent" mode
3. Provide your prompt and let Copilot work through the solution systematically

## Example Use Cases

### Adding Unregister Functionality
Instead of making theoretical changes that may not work together, Agent mode can:
- Add delete buttons to the frontend
- Implement the backend API endpoint
- Ensure proper error handling
- Test the integration between components

### Database Migration
Agent mode can handle complex tasks like:
- Installing database services
- Migrating from in-memory storage to persistent databases
- Updating all related code to use the new database
- Testing the migration to ensure data integrity

## Best Practices

- **Be specific** in your prompts about what you want to achieve
- **Provide context** about the existing codebase and constraints
- **Review results** and provide additional feedback if needed
- **Try different models** (like Claude 3.5 Sonnet) if available for different perspectives
