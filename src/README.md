## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                                                          | Description                                                         |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

All data is stored in memory, which means data will be reset when the server restarts.

## GitHub Copilot Agent Mode

This repository also serves as a learning exercise for GitHub Copilot's **Agent Mode**. Agent Mode is an enhanced version of Copilot that provides automatic feedback loops and can handle complex, multi-step tasks.

For detailed information about Agent Mode, including features, use cases, and examples, see the [Copilot Agent Mode documentation](../COPILOT_AGENT_MODE.md).
